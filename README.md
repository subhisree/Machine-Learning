# Phishing-Site-Detection
Python Codes for Detecting Phishing Sites
This code consists of 5 different models. They are :
1.Logistic Regression
2.Decision Tree
3.Support Vector Machine Rbf
4.Random Forest
5.XG Boost
6.Neural Network

This code uses a stack ensemble. Here the predictions given by the first 5 models is added to the acctual dataset to create a new dataset
35 parameters for training varaible and 1 test variable. 
These 35 variables are fed as input to the neural network to obtain an output.

The .arff dataset used here for detecting phishing sites was taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
